# Advent of Code JavaScript Solutions

This is a repository for me to attempt the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) challenges in JavaScript.

In past years I've solved them using C# and F#. [read about my solutions here](http://markheath.net/category/advent+of+code). This repository is for me to improve my JavaScript skills by re-attempting past challenges in JavaScript (and possibly attempting the 2017 challenges in JavaScript too)

To get started:
```
npm install
```

To solve all puzzles for this year

```
node index.js
```

To run all tests for 2015:
```
node index.js 2015
```

To run tests for 2015 day 10
```
node index.js 2015 10
```

To run Jasmine unit tests
```
npm test
```
