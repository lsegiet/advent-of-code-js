# Advent of Code JavaScript Solutions

This is a repository for me to attempt the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) challenges in JavaScript.

In past years I've solved them using C# and F#. [read about my solutions here](http://markheath.net/category/advent+of+code). This repository is for me to improve my JavaScript skills by re-attempting past challenges in JavaScript (and possibly attempting the 2017 challenges in JavaScript too)

To run

```
npm install
node index.js
```
